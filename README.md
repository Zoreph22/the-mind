<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<br />

This project basic principle is: a simple version of the existing card game **[The Mind](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244992/mind)** playable in multiplayer (in LAN or Internet) and with bots.

To give a brief idea of the game, it is a game in several rounds. In the first round, each player receives a card with a number between 1 and 100. Each player must play the cards in ascending order, from the smallest to the largest, otherwise the round is lost, so the game is cooperative. Be careful, no player is allowed to communicate either verbally or physically, hence the difficulty.

We have slightly modified the original game, to add three lives, when a round is lost, a life is lost. There is no limit to the number of rounds.

### Features

- [x] Playable with up to 20 players and bots.
- [x] Stats generation in a PDF file at game end.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To play the game, you have to run a server (game), while clients (human players) connect to it.

1. Start the server: run the executable `src/ServerProject/ServerProject`.  
2. Start one or more clients (on the same machine or not): run the executable `src/ClientProject/ClientProject`.  
   On the login screen, you must type the IP address (`127.0.0.1` if the server is on the same machine) and port `25565` of the server to connect.

*Note: if you want to play on the Internet, you must open the TCP port `25565` on your firewall.*
